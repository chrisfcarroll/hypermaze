Dependancies
************

Before instalation can be started a few libraries must be installed.

The only compulsary library is Irrlicht (http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/)

There are various optional libraries that enable other features to be used which are:
 * For url and internet access to levels - libCURL (https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
 * For sound ALUT and OpenAL (Hard to find. Often available in linux distros)

Note that for compiling the dev versions of packages will be needed as well as the actual library

Installation Instructions
*************************

This program is configured for build and install using the cmake system.

The first step to building and installing this program is to download and
install cmake. It can be downloaded and installed from http://www.cmake.org/
or using your systems package repository system (where relevent). Note some
systems have multiple frontends for cmake.

To configure the program, first make a directory to build the code in, and then
in that folder run
        cmake -G <GENERATOR> <PATH_TO_SOURCE>
where <GENERATOR> is the name of the build system to setup for and 
<PATH TO SOURCE> is the path to the folder contaning this file. The list of
generators available will vary from system to system. See `cmake --help` for
the full list.

If there are any problems or libraries not found then cmake will print an error
message. Set the relevent variables (using -Dvar=value or a gui) and rerun till
cmake has found all the relevent libraries. Some libraries are optional. A
message will be printed if they aren't found and relevent features will be
turned off.

There are also settings for the install location (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=guessed 
by cmake) and build type (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug", "Release", "RelWithDebInfo"
or "MinSizeRel").

If using a gui version then the instructions will be slightly differnet but the
basic idea is the same. For the interactive terminal version just replace cmake
with ccmake in the above command. For the qt or windows gui version run the
program then fill in build directory, path to source and generator when
requested.

If using a makefile based generator, use the commands
        make && make install
to make and then install the main program

The build system will also include targets to build the levelgen and scriptedit
programs but these can't installed and aren't compiled by default.
