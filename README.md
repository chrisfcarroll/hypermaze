Welcome to the repository for Hypermaze by staircase (staircase27 on bitbucket)

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is currently private and is my dev location for developing hypermaze.
Hypermaze is a 3D maze like puzzle where you have to get a "string" through a "maze".
For more explanations run the puzzle or for information about hypermazes in general 
see http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/hypermaz.htm

### How do I get set up? ###

For details of building and installing hypermaze see the file INSTALL. This repo
contains three programs. The three programs are:

* hypermaze - the actual puzzle and the default program to build
* scriptedit - a scripteditor for making scripted levels
* test - a test program that is the starting block for making a level file generator
