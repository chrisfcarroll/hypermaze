Welcome to the repository for Hypermaze by staircase (staircase27 on bitbucket)

### What is this repository for? ###

This is the repository for hypermaze. Hypermaze is a 3D maze like puzzle where you 
have to get a "string" through a "maze". For more explanations run the puzzle or
for information about hypermazes in general see 
http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/hypermaz.htm

### How do I get set up? ###

For details of building and installing hypermaze see the file INSTALL. This repo
contains the code for three programs. The three programs are:

* hypermaze - the actual puzzle and the default program to build
* scriptedit - a scripteditor for making scripted levels (mainly used for tutorials)
* test - a test program that is the starting block for making a level file generator

### Contribution guidelines ###

This is a project by staircase and is open source under the GLP2 licence. I am not
actively looking for contributions at this time but if people find interesting bugs
and want to fix them then I would be grateful if you could send me the code to be
included in the official version. I will of course acknowledge you on the changelog.

For anything else please contact me on the address below.
