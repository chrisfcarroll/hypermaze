Welcome to the repoistory for Hypermaze by staircase (staircase27 on bitbucket)

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is currently private and is my dev location for developing hypermaze.
Hypermaze is a 3D maze like puzzle where you have to get a string through a "maze".
For more explanations run the puzzle or see http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/hypermaz.htm

### How do I get set up? ###

This currently only is setup for me to compile. It's setup to compile on linux or windows and to produce 3 programs.
The three programs are:

* hypermaze - the actual puzzle and the default program to build
* scriptedit - a scripteditor for making scripted levels
*  test - a test program that is the starting block for making a level file generator

There is currently an issue that you can't compile all three in the same tree as they make with different compile time options
