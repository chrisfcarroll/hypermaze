1 1 1 0 1 2 4 24:B "Welcome to the Third and Final Hypermaze Tutorial" : "So far you have always been able to move the string steadily closer to the end but in some levels, such as this one, you have to bring loops of string back towards the start to solve the maze." : "For example in this level there is a barrier pointing towards the back of the maze that comes from the top of the maze. Normally this would mean you need to bring the string under that wall but it is surrounded by rings of barrier attached to the bottom of the maze which you need to go over first. The simplest and best way to solve these kinds of situations is to move the string as close to the blockage as possible then bring a small loop of string back towards the edge of the maze, over the end of the barrier that is blocking the string and back towards the rest of the string and the end of the maze." : "It is possible to solve this level with a score of 26. Go ahead and try and solve it now."
