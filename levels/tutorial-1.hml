The direction you are trying to move the string is shown by an arrow on the floor, the colour change of the floor (towards the blue side) and the different coloured handle on the side you are aiming for (we will explain what the handles do a little later)." ::0000 "<space>" : "Firstly though lets explain how to move the string." 2 5 24:B "Moving the String" ::0000 "<space>" : "To move the string click on it and drag with the left mouse button in the direction you want it to go. You can also move it with the keyboard. The default keys are up, down, left, right, Page Up and Page Down but the current mappings can be checked from the help screen." ::0000 "<space>" : "Please drag the string to the top of the maze to continue." 7 2 63 0 0 0 2 63 0 0 0 4 3 3 5 0 0 6 1 7 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 1 4 4 0 0 0 1 2 5 24:B "Changing your view" ::0000 "<space>" : "You may have noticed that it wasn't very easy to see what you where doing or control the direction of dragging from that angle. To change your viewing direction click and drag with the right mouse button anywhere other than on the string." ::0000 "<space>" : "Once you have finished trying changing your view drag the string to the bottom of the maze to continue." 4 3 3 5 1 0 6 2 7 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 3 2 9 24:B "Selecting the String" ::0000 "<space>" : "So far the entire string has always moved whenever you dragged it. This would be fine for this level as there are no obsticles but for most levels you will need to bend and stretch the string. This is done by moving only part of the string." ::0000 "<space>" : "To move only part of the string we need to select only part of the string. The selected parts of the string are purple and the unselected parts are blue. To select or deselect segments of the string right click on them." ::0000 "<space>" : "It is also possible to select or deselect multiple elements at once by right clicking on an element and dragging towards one of the ends of the string and to select or deselect the entire string at once by double clicking on the string." ::0000 "<space>" : "For now though we have deslected the entire string so can you select just the centre element of the string and then drag it towards the end of the maze until it is out the far side." 9 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 2 63 0 0 0 2 63 1 -1000 -1000 0 0
