9 1 1 0 3 2 4 24:B "Welcome to the Hypermaze Tutorial" : "This tutorial will guide you through how to use this puzzle and how to solve hypermazes." : "Your challenge is to manoeuvre the string (blue/purple) from one side of the maze to the other. You are aiming to move the string to the blue side of the maze, as shown by the blue floor and blue sphere on that side of the maze. There is also a large black arrow on the floor pointing in the direction you are trying to move the string." : "Firstly though let's explain how to move the string." 2 3 24:B "Moving the String" : "To move the string, click on it and drag with the left mouse button in the direction you want it to go. You can also move it with the keyboard. The default keys are up, down, left, right, Page Up and Page Down for the six possible directions, but the current mappings can be checked from the Help screen." : "Please drag the string to the top of the maze to continue." 7 2 63 0 0 0 2 63 0 0 0 4 3 3 5 0 0 6 1 7 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 1 4 4 0 0 0 1 2 3 24:B "Changing your view" : "You may have noticed that it wasn't very easy to see what you were doing or to control the direction of dragging from that viewing angle. To change your viewing direction, click and drag with the right mouse button anywhere other than on the string." : "Once you have finished experimenting with changing your view, drag the string to the bottom of the maze to continue." 4 3 3 5 1 0 6 2 7 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 4 2 5 24:B "Selecting the String" : "So far the entire string has always moved whenever you dragged it. This would be fine for this level as there are no obstacles but for most levels you will need to bend and stretch the string. This is done by moving different parts of the string at a time." : "To move only some of the string we need to select which parts we want to move. The selected parts of the string are purple and the unselected parts are blue. To select or deselect segments of the string, right click on them." : "It is also possible to select or deselect multiple elements at once. You can do this by right clicking on an element and dragging towards one of the ends of the string. You can also select or deselect the entire string at once by double clicking on the string." : "For now though we have deselected the entire string, so please can you select just the centre element of the string and then drag it towards the end of the maze until it is out the far side." 9 1 0 100 1 2 63 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 2 63 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 10 1 1 1 1 4 3 3 5 2 0 6 3 7 5 1 100 1 2 2 0 0 0 1 100 1 2 45 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 0 0 1 5 5 1 100 1 2 45 0 0 0 1 100 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 24:B "Nearly Done" : "To finish this first tutorial and move on to an actual puzzle, bring the rest of the string to the end of the maze to join the first element. You can do this by selecting the elements still at the start of the maze and dragging them towards to end of the maze. You don't want to select the elements going pointing forwards or backwards through the maze as that stops them collapsing." 2 6 3 3 2 5 3 0 0 2 5 "levels/tutorial-2.hml" "Tutorial 2" 4 2 : "You should now understand the aim and basic controls of Hypermaze." : "For the next tutorial you will have a proper level to solve and we will explain the scoring and give a few more tips." 8 3 2 5 0 0 6 1 0 2 2 2 24:B "Oops!
