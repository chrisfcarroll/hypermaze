2 1 1 0 1 2 4 24:B "Welcome to the Second Hypermaze Tutorial" : "This time we have given you a full maze to solve. Remember your aim is to get the string from one side of the maze to the other by bending and stretching the string." : "The challenge though is to try and do this with the smallest area solution. As you stretch and move the string you trace out a surface and the area of this surface is your score, which is shown bottom left of the screen and in the window title. You therefore want to have the lowest score possible." : "Go ahead and solve the maze and we will give you a few hints along the way." 4 3 2 6 1 7 3 0 100 1 2 63 0 0 1 -100 1 1 100 1 2 63 0 0 1 2 1000 0 100 1 2 63 0 0 1 -100 1 0 2 3 24:B "Hiding part of the maze!" : "It can get quite hard to see what's going on inside the maze, so to make it easier we have made it possible to hide parts of the maze." : "You do this using the spheres floating outside the maze. If you click on one of them and drag towards the middle of the maze, layers of the maze from that side will be hidden. If you drag away from the centre of the maze, then layers of the maze will be shown again. You can also double click on a sphere to show all layers of the maze on that side (other sides may still be hidden though)."
